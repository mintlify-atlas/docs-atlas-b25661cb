title: Tools Overview
description: Built-in tools available in Loom for file operations, search, shell commands, and decision tracking
---

Loom provides a comprehensive set of built-in tools that enable AI agents to interact with codebases, execute commands, and track decisions. All tools are implemented as Jido Actions with structured schemas and consistent error handling.

## Common Patterns

### Path Resolution

All file and directory paths are relative to the project root. Loom automatically:
- Validates paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Resolves relative paths against the project directory
- Returns absolute paths in results for clarity

### Error Handling

All tools return structured results:

```elixir
# Success
{:ok, %{result: "Operation completed successfully"}}

# Error
{:error, "Descriptive error message"}
```

### Output Formatting

Tools format output consistently:
- File paths are relative to project root
- Line numbers use 1-based indexing
- Results include headers with counts and metadata

## Safety Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Path Validation">
    All file operations use `safe_path!/2` to prevent access outside the project directory:
    ```elixir
    # Blocked
    file_path: "../../../etc/passwd"
    # Allowed  
    file_path: "lib/my_app/router.ex"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Output Limits">
    Search and shell tools limit output to prevent overwhelming responses:
    - Content search: 100 matches maximum
    - Shell output: 10,000 characters maximum
    - File read: configurable with `offset` and `limit` parameters
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Directory Exclusions">
    Search tools automatically exclude common build and dependency directories:
    - `.git`, `_build`, `deps`, `node_modules`
    - `.elixir_ls`, `.lexical`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tool Schema Format

All tools use NimbleOptions schemas with typed parameters:

```elixir
schema: [
  file_path: [type: :string, required: true, doc: "Path to the file"],
  offset: [type: :integer, doc: "Line number to start from"],
  limit: [type: :integer, doc: "Maximum lines to return"]
]
```
