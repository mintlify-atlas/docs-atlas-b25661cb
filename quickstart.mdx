## Choose Your Interface

Loom offers two ways to interact with your AI coding assistant:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Web UI" icon="window">
    Real-time streaming chat, file browser, diff viewer, and decision graph visualization
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="CLI" icon="terminal">
    REPL-style interface with markdown rendering and colored diffs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Both interfaces connect to the same session GenServer, so you can switch between them mid-conversation.

## Web UI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Phoenix server">
    ```bash
    mix phx.server
    ```
    
    You'll see output like:
    
    ```
    [info] Running LoomWeb.Endpoint with Bandit 1.6.0 at 127.0.0.1:4200 (http)
    [info] Access LoomWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:4200
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open the workspace">
    Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.
    
    The workspace has four main areas:
    
    - **Chat panel** — Send messages and see streaming responses
    - **File tree** — Browse your project files
    - **Tabs** — Switch between Files, Diffs, Decision Graph, and Terminal
    - **Model selector** — Choose which LLM to use
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send your first message">
    Click into the chat input at the bottom and type a question:
    
    ```
    What is this project about? Show me the main application file.
    ```
    
    Press `Shift+Enter` to send (or click the send button).
    
    Watch as Loom:
    1. Uses the `directory_list` tool to explore the project structure
    2. Uses `file_read` to read relevant files
    3. Responds with a summary and shows you the code
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approve tool permissions">
    When Loom wants to use a tool that requires permission (like `file_write` or `shell`), you'll see a permission modal.
    
    Review the tool parameters and approve or deny the operation.
    
    <Tip>
      You can grant session-wide approval by checking "Remember this decision" or configure auto-approved tools in `.loom.toml`.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View the decision graph">
    Click the **Decision Graph** tab to see an interactive SVG visualization of Loom's reasoning:
    
    - **Blue nodes** — Goals and decisions
    - **Green nodes** — Actions and outcomes
    - **Yellow nodes** — Observations
    - **Edges** — Relationships (leads_to, chosen, rejected, etc.)
    
    The graph persists across sessions, so Loom remembers why decisions were made.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## CLI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build the escript (if you haven't already)">
    ```bash
    mix escript.build
    ```
    
    This creates a `./loom` executable in your project directory.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start an interactive session">
    Navigate to your project directory and run:
    
    ```bash
    ./loom --project /path/to/your/project
    ```
    
    Or from within your project:
    
    ```bash
    ./loom --project .
    ```
    
    You'll see the Loom prompt:
    
    ```
    Loom v0.1.0 — Elixir-native AI coding assistant
    Session: abc123-def456
    Model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
    Project: /Users/you/my-project
    Type /help for commands, /quit to exit
    
    >
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ask a question">
    Type a question and press Enter:
    
    ```
    > What does the auth module do?
    ```
    
    Loom will:
    1. Search for auth-related files using `file_search`
    2. Read the most relevant files with `file_read`
    3. Analyze the code and respond with an explanation
    
    You'll see the tool calls and their results streamed in real-time.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make an edit">
    Ask Loom to modify code:
    
    ```
    > Add a function to the user schema that checks if a user is an admin
    ```
    
    Loom will:
    1. Read the user schema file
    2. Propose an edit using `file_edit`
    3. Show you a colored diff
    4. Ask for approval
    
    You'll see output like:
    
    ```diff
    lib/my_app/accounts/user.ex
    @@ -45,6 +45,11 @@
       field :email, :string
       field :role, :string, default: "user"
     end
    +
    +  def admin?(user) do
    +    user.role == "admin"
    +  end
     end
    ```
    
    Approve with `y` or deny with `n`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## CLI Commands

Once in an interactive session, you can use these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/model <name>` | Switch LLM model mid-session |
| `/history` | Show conversation history |
| `/sessions` | List all saved sessions |
| `/clear` | Clear the terminal |
| `/quit` or `/exit` | Exit Loom |

## CLI Options

<ParamField path="--model" type="string" default="From config">
  Specify which LLM model to use:
  
  ```bash
  ./loom --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-6 --project .
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--project" type="string" default="Current directory">
  Path to your project directory:
  
  ```bash
  ./loom --project /path/to/project
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--yes" type="boolean" default="false">
  Auto-approve all permission prompts:
  
  ```bash
  ./loom --yes --project .
  ```
  
  <Warning>
    Use with caution. This skips all permission checks for file writes and shell commands.
  </Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--resume" type="string">
  Resume a previous session by ID:
  
  ```bash
  ./loom --resume abc123-def456 --project .
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--help" type="boolean">
  Show help message and exit:
  
  ```bash
  ./loom --help
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--version" type="boolean">
  Show version and exit:
  
  ```bash
  ./loom --version
  ```
</ParamField>

## One-Shot Mode

You can ask a single question without entering an interactive session:

```bash
./loom --project . "What does the auth module do?"
```

Loom will respond and exit. This is useful for:

- Quick code explanations
- CI/CD integrations
- Scripting and automation

## Example Session: Fixing a Failing Test

Here's a real example of using Loom to fix a failing test:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run your tests">
    ```bash
    > Can you run the tests and fix any failures?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Loom uses the shell tool">
    ```
    [tool] shell
    command: mix test
    
    [result]
    1) test user validation requires email (MyApp.AccountsTest)
       test/my_app/accounts_test.exs:45
       Expected truthy, got false
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Loom reads the test file">
    ```
    [tool] file_read
    file_path: test/my_app/accounts_test.exs
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Loom reads the implementation">
    ```
    [tool] file_read
    file_path: lib/my_app/accounts/user.ex
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Loom proposes a fix">
    ```
    The test is failing because the user changeset isn't validating that
    email is required. I'll add a validation:
    
    [tool] file_edit
    file_path: lib/my_app/accounts/user.ex
    old_string: ||
      def changeset(user, attrs) do
        user
        |> cast(attrs, [:email, :name])
      end
    new_string: ||
      def changeset(user, attrs) do
        user
        |> cast(attrs, [:email, :name])
        |> validate_required([:email])
      end
    ```
    
    You'll see a diff and be asked to approve.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Loom verifies the fix">
    ```
    [tool] shell
    command: mix test
    
    [result]
    Finished in 0.3 seconds
    42 tests, 0 failures
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Rules

Create a `LOOM.md` file in your project root to give Loom persistent instructions:

```markdown LOOM.md
# Project Instructions

This is a Phoenix LiveView app using Ecto with PostgreSQL.

## Rules
- Always run `mix format` after editing .ex files
- Run `mix test` before committing
- Use `binary_id` for all primary keys
- Follow the context module pattern in `lib/myapp/`

## Allowed Operations
- Shell: `mix *`, `git *`, `elixir *`
- File Write: `lib/**`, `test/**`, `priv/repo/migrations/**`
- File Write Denied: `config/runtime.exs`, `.env*`
```

Loom will load these rules automatically and follow them across all sessions.
