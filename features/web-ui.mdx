Loom's web interface provides a rich, visual environment for interacting with your AI coding assistant. See file changes, terminal output, and project structure all in one place.

## Overview

The web UI is a Phoenix LiveView application that runs locally and provides:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Chat Interface" icon="comments">
    Conversational coding with markdown rendering and code highlighting
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="File Explorer" icon="folder-tree">
    Browse your project structure with instant file preview
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Diff Viewer" icon="code-compare">
    Visual unified diffs for all file changes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Terminal Output" icon="terminal">
    See command execution results in real-time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Starting the Web UI

Launch the web interface:

```bash
mix phx.server
```

Then open your browser to:
```
http://localhost:4200
```

A new session starts automatically when you load the page.

## Interface Layout

The workspace is divided into three main areas:

### Header Bar

The top bar displays:
- **Loom logo** - Brand and app identifier
- **Model selector** - Change AI models on the fly
- **Mode toggle** - Switch between Normal and Architect mode
- **Cost tracker** - Running total of tokens and API costs
- **Session switcher** - Navigate between active sessions
- **Status indicator** - Current session state (Ready, Thinking, Running tool)

### Main Chat Area

The central panel shows your conversation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Messages">
    Type your request in the text area at the bottom. Press Shift+Enter to submit.
    
    ```
    Add authentication to the user module
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View Responses">
    Loom's responses appear with:
    - Markdown formatting
    - Syntax-highlighted code blocks
    - File path references
    - Collapsible tool results
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Track Progress">
    Watch real-time indicators:
    - "Thinking..." with animated pulse
    - "Running file_read..." with spinner
    - Tool results in expandable details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sidebar Tabs

The right sidebar has four tabs:

#### Files Tab

Browse and preview your project files:

- **Tree view** with expand/collapse folders
- **Filter input** to search by filename
- **Click to preview** - file contents appear below the tree
- **Syntax coloring** - different colors for file types
- **Stats footer** - total file count and size

**Skipped directories**: `.git`, `_build`, `deps`, `node_modules`, `.loom`, `.elixir_ls`

#### Diff Tab

Visual diff viewer for all file changes:

- **Unified diff format** with line numbers
- **Color-coded changes**:
  - Green background: Added lines
  - Red background: Deleted lines
  - Gray: Context lines
- **Collapsible files** - click file name to expand/collapse
- **Addition/deletion counts** - see +/- line counts per file

Each diff shows:
```
[▼] src/user.ex                    +5 -2
```

Expand to see the full unified diff with old and new line numbers.

#### Terminal Tab

View output from shell commands:

- **Command history** - all executed commands
- **Exit codes** - success/failure indicators
- **stdout/stderr** - full command output
- **Scrollable** - review long output

#### Graph Tab

Visual decision graph showing:
- Session flow and branching
- Tool invocations
- Decision points

<Info>
  The graph view uses the decision logging system to track Loom's reasoning process.
</Info>

## Session Management

### Creating Sessions

Click **New Session** in the session switcher to start a fresh conversation.

Each session:
- Has a unique ID (first 8 characters shown in UI)
- Maintains its own conversation history
- Tracks independent cost/token metrics
- Can be resumed later

### Switching Sessions

Use the session switcher dropdown to:
1. View all active sessions
2. Switch to a different session
3. See session status (idle, thinking, executing)

Sessions persist across page refreshes.

### Session URLs

Each session has a unique URL:
```
http://localhost:4200/sessions/abc12345-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
```

Bookmark or share session URLs to return to specific conversations.

## Model Selection

### Changing Models

Click the model selector dropdown to choose from available models:

- `anthropic:claude-opus-4-6` - Most capable, slower, higher cost
- `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6` - Balanced performance (default)
- `anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5` - Fast, lower cost

The model change takes effect immediately for the next message.

### Model Configuration

Models are defined in your `.loom.toml`:

```toml
[model]
default = "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6"
weak = "anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5"
architect = "anthropic:claude-opus-4-6"
editor = "anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5"
```

## Architect Mode

Toggle the **Architect** button to enable two-model workflow:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Normal Mode">
    **Single model** handles everything:
    - Planning
    - Code writing
    - Testing
    - Debugging
    
    Best for: Quick tasks, simple changes, exploration
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Architect Mode">
    **Two-model system**:
    
    1. **Architect** (stronger model):
       - Analyzes requirements
       - Creates implementation plan
       - Coordinates sub-tasks
       - Reviews changes
    
    2. **Editor** (faster model):
       - Executes file edits
       - Runs tests
       - Applies changes
    
    Best for: Large refactorings, complex features, multi-file changes
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The mode badge shows current state:
- **Normal** (gray) - single model
- **Architect** (purple) - two-model mode

## Permission Dialogs

When Loom needs to perform write or execute operations, a modal appears:

```
Permission Required

Allow file_edit on src/user.ex?

[Deny] [Allow Once] [Allow Always]
```

<ResponseField name="Actions">
  - **Deny**: Reject this operation, Loom continues without it
  - **Allow Once**: Approve this single operation
  - **Allow Always**: Auto-approve all operations for this session
</ResponseField>

### Auto-Approve Config

Set tools to auto-approve in `.loom.toml`:

```toml
[permissions]
auto_approve = [
  "file_read",
  "content_search",
  "directory_list"
]
```

## Real-Time Updates

The UI updates live as Loom works:

1. **Status changes**: Idle → Thinking → Executing tool → Idle
2. **Message streaming**: Assistant responses appear as they're generated
3. **Tool execution**: Spinners and indicators show active tools
4. **Diff updates**: New diffs appear automatically after edits
5. **Terminal output**: Command results stream in real-time

No page refresh needed - everything updates via Phoenix LiveView.

## Cost Dashboard

Click the cost display in the header to open the full dashboard:

```
$0.0042 / 2.3k tok
```

The dashboard shows:
- **Total cost** across all sessions
- **Token usage** (prompt + completion)
- **Cost per session**
- **Cost per model**
- **Historical trends**

Access at: `http://localhost:4200/dashboard`

## Keyboard Shortcuts

<ResponseField name="Shift + Enter">
  Submit message in text area
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Esc">
  Close permission dialog (denies request)
</ResponseField>

## File Tree Features

### Filtering Files

Type in the filter input to search:
```
Filter files... user
```

Shows only files/folders matching "user" (case-insensitive).

### File Preview

Click any file to see its contents:
- Opens in split view below the tree
- Syntax-free plain text display
- Close with × button
- Full scrolling for large files

### Expandable Folders

- ▶ Collapsed folder
- ▼ Expanded folder

State persists during your session.

## Message Display

### User Messages

Your messages appear on the right side with gray background.

### Assistant Messages

- Monospace font for readability

## Responsive Design

The UI adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop** (1400px+): Full layout with sidebar
- **Laptop** (1024px+): Compact sidebar
- **Tablet/Mobile** (768px): Stacked layout, collapsible panels

## Dark Theme

Loom uses a dark color scheme optimized for long coding sessions:

- Background: `#030712` (gray-950)
- Panels: `#111827` (gray-900)
- Borders: `#1f2937` (gray-800)
- Primary: `#6366f1` (indigo-400)
- Text: `#f3f4f6` (gray-100)

## Browser Support

<Check>Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave)</Check>
<Check>Firefox</Check>
<Check>Safari</Check>

Requires:
- JavaScript enabled
- WebSocket support
- Modern CSS (flexbox, grid)

## Performance

### Live Updates

Phoenix LiveView uses WebSockets for real-time updates without polling.

### Large Files

File preview is limited to prevent browser slowdown:
- Display limit: Full file
- Diff truncation: After 2000 chars in tool results

### Session History

All messages are kept in memory. For very long sessions (100+ messages), consider starting a new session.
